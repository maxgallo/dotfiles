# Max's dotfiles
My personal collection of dotfiles.

## How it works ?
There are 8 fundamental scrips and then a bunch more inside the `more` folder.
You can both install and uninstall each single thing.

**Install** `./script.sh`
**Uninstall** `./script.sh --remove`

## Available Scripts
```bash
./macos.sh
./brew.sh
./git.sh
./tmux.sh
./vim.sh
./fish.sh
./nvm.sh
./iterm.sh

cd more
./awscli
./shuttle
```
